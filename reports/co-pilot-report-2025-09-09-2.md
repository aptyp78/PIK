# co-pilot report (2025-09-09 / 2)

## Summary

Second report for 2025-09-09. Repository state is synchronized with origin/main (HEAD 0ed938b). Previous rebase and force push completed. No working tree changes.

## Git State

- HEAD: 0ed938b (Refactor code structure for improved readability and maintainability)
- Remote origin/main: identical
- Working tree: clean

## Implemented Recently

- PDF Services token module (`lib/adobe/pdfToken.ts`)
- Adobe health endpoint (`app/api/health/adobe/route.ts`)
- Diagnostics & demo pages (`app/demo`, `app/frames`)
- Reporting script & sample report
- Refactored structure for clarity

## Pending / Next Options

1. Integrate Adobe health summary into base `/api/health` endpoint.
2. Add automated script to run ingest + search + health and append summarized report.
3. Add minimal tests (parsing, block normalization) for `adobeExtract` flow.
4. Provide fallback note in README about legacy IMS token removal timeline.

## Risks / Notes

- Force push rewrote history; collaborators must rebase or reset.
- `/api/health/adobe` still depends on environment (client id/secret) for green status.

## Suggested Immediate Step

Choose which enhancement to prioritize (health integration, automation, or tests) before further refactors.
